lysdr - simple software-defined radio

Requirements: gtk and jack, waf to build

1. Configure with "waf configure"
2. Build with "waf build"
3. Run with "./build/default/gui"

On startup, lysdr will connect its output to the jack output ports.
You will need to connect some sort of IQ source to the inputs - this can
be either a real live soundcard with some SDR hardware, or a prerecorded
IQ file.

At present lysdr only demodulates LSB, but can be adapted for USB.
