lysdr - simple software-defined radio

Requirements: gtk and jack, waf to build

1. Configure with "waf configure"
2. Build with "waf build"
3. Run with "./build/default/gui"

On startup, lysdr will connect its output to the jack output ports.
You will need to connect some sort of IQ source to the inputs - this can
be either a real live soundcard with some SDR hardware, or a prerecorded
IQ file.

Drag the slider to tune the radio.  The number above the slider is the
frequency offset in Hz from the SDR centre (local oscillator) frequency.
Filter bandwith is adjustable, with hardcoded 250 taps in the FIR.
At present lysdr only demodulates LSB, but can be adapted for USB.
