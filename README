lysdr - simple software-defined radio

Requirements: gtk, fftw3 and jack, waf to build

1. Configure with "./waf configure"
2. Build with "./waf build"
3. Run with "./build/default/lysdr"

On startup, lysdr will connect its output to the first two jack physical
output ports if you pass "--co"
You will need to connect some sort of IQ source to the inputs - this can
be either a real live soundcard with some SDR hardware, or a prerecorded
IQ file.  To automatically connect the first two physical input ports on
startup, pass "--ci" on the command line.

Set the displayed centre frequency with  --freq <frequency>
For the Softrock v6.2 Lite boards, the standard centre frequencies are:
160m =  1844250
80m  =  3528000
40m  =  7056000
30m  = 10125000
20m  = 14075000
15m  = 21045000 

These options may change in a future build.

Example:
## don't connect anything
$ ./build/default/gui

## connect both input and output to lysdr
$ ./build/default/gui --ci --co 

Drag the slider to tune the radio.  The number below the slider is the
frequency offset in Hz from the SDR centre (local oscillator) frequency.
Right-drag for bandspread tuning (1Hz steps).

Drag the sides of the yellow filter bar to adjust the bandpass filter upper and
lower edges.

There are toggle buttons to select fast and slow AGC, wide and narrow filtering
and USB/LSB demodulation.  There's also a not-very-good S meter.


KNOWN BUGS:
the horrible hack to cure the filter denormals introduces a bit of noise.  This
noise is normally inaudibly quiet compared to real signals, but with the input
disconnected the AGC ramps up until it is audible
