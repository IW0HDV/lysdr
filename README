lysdr - simple software-defined radio

Requirements: gtk, fftw3 and jack, waf to build

1. Configure with "./waf configure"
2. Build with "./waf build"
3. Run with "./build/default/gui"

On startup, lysdr will connect its output to the jack output ports.
You will need to connect some sort of IQ source to the inputs - this can
be either a real live soundcard with some SDR hardware, or a prerecorded
IQ file.

Drag the slider to tune the radio.  The number above the slider is the
frequency offset in Hz from the SDR centre (local oscillator) frequency.
Right-drag for bandspread tuning (1Hz steps).

At present lysdr only demodulates LSB, but can be adapted for USB.

KNOWN BUGS:
Crashes when resizing
after resizing, the scale no longer accurately tracks the tuning
